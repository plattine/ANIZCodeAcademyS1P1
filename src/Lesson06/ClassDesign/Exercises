1. Create a class named Tomato.
The class must have 2 attributes (for example: name and color, or weight and ripeness).
Two constructors:
    one constructor that sets both attributes
    one constructor with no parameters
Getter and setter methods for both attributes.
A toString() method that returns a descriptive text of the tomato.

2. Create two Tomato objects using new.
Print the tomato objects using System.out.println.
Make sure that the toString() method is used.
